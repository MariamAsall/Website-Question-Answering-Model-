# Website Question Answering Model (Basic Chatbot)

## Overview

This project implements a foundational web-based chatbot or question-answering system. It's designed to provide responses to user queries, likely based on predefined rules or scripts. The core of the system is demonstrated within a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for interactive development and testing.

## Features

-   **Basic Question Answering:** Provides answers to user queries.
-   **Jupyter Notebook Interface:** Interactive development and testing environment.
-   **Script-Based Responses:** Uses a JSON file to store response logic or conversational flow.
-   **Web-Based Concept:** Designed with a web application context in mind, although the core logic is in the notebook.

## Project Structure

-   `chatbot2.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the chatbot's logic and interactive execution.
-   `scripts.json`: A JSON file that likely defines the chatbot's questions, answers, or conversational scripts.
-   `README.md`: This documentation file.
