parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, try the two criminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet justice be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, the police authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir negligence is evident,\n\n\nor at least probable,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut it lies outside the jurisdiction\n\n\nof a circuit court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an administrative matter\n\n\nthat can be handled internally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, bring an action\n\n\nagainst the rally organizers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir inflammatory speech makes them\n\n\nmorally responsible for the violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an old rule of thumb.\n\n\nWho stands to gain the most?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe justice minister asked me\n\n\nif you were a Leftist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI categorically denied it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a list\n\n\nof useful witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems no one meant to kill\n\n\nthe deputy, just intimidate him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI trust I've convinced you\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto protect the honor\n\n\nof the forces of law and order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you're accountable only\n\n\nto your conscience, after God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI won't bear this dishonor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndict me\n\n\nand I'll commit suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDishonor is intolerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf need be, my blood will flow\n\n\nin this very room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName and occupation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign your statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are officially charged\n\n\nwith first-degree murder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour arrest warrant is ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law grants officers\n\n\n24 hours before incarceration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid the press,\n\n\nuse that door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are charged\n\n\nwith first-degree murder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is intolerable!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisgraceful!\n\n\nYou have no right!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been thrown to the

cleared\n\n\nor I commit suicide to avoid dishonor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName and occupation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's routine, General.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you do the day\n\n\nof the murder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd decided to attend the Bolshoi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot out of love for dance.\n\n\nI'm no pervert, thank God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it was a chance\n\n\nto spot sympathizers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe morning of the murder,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou were informed\n\n\nof a threat on the victim's life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one told me\n\n\nof any death threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm convinced it was only a tactic\n\n\nto justify any incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy men couldn't stop\n\n\nthe three-wheeler,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut a man leaped\n\n\nonto the flatbed,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike a tiger,\n\n\nlithe and ferocious as a tiger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know no one\n\n\nin that organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have no contact\n\n\nwith these combatants... this CROC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a photo of a banquet\n\n\nyou gave for them\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas thanks for maintaining order\n\n\nduring a state visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs he a Communist?\n\n\nWhy is he after me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis father was a colonel\n\n\nin the military police.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis photo's doctored.\n\n\nIt's no proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-degree murder\n\n\nand abuse of authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you a victim like Dreyfus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDreyfus was guilty!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH?l?ne!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've all been charged,\n\n\neven the general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magistrate didn't back down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see?\n\n\nIt's as if he were still alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a real revolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will fall.\n\n\nThe extremists will be swept away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe elections will be\n\n\na landslide victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE

time,\n\n\nwhen I filmed myself at home,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat one point I talked to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow you didn't understand...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth you and Avi told me\n\n\nyou

we've\n\n\nbeen fighting about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the fight we had when\n\n\nwe didn't speak for 2 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the camera rolling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how the film begins.\n\n\nOkay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unidentified figure\n\n\nwearing a hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfaces the camera and waits\n\n\nfor the crew to set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand tell him everything's ready\n\n\nso he can begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they say the camera is rolling,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe figure takes a piece of paper\n\n\nand begins to read a testimony:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then one evening,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"we were driving along Road 443,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"back when there were\n\n\nstill shootings on 443,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"we went to arrest\n\n\na 'wanted'

son,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill walk in from his room\n\n\ndown the hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand stare in amazement at\n\n\nwhat his father is doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's familiar with...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this time,\n\n\nit's stranger than usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr else he'll sit there\n\n\nand watch us,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike a bunch of retarded adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, maybe there'll be\n\n\nsomething with Michael.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill continue with the testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And suddenly our bus stopped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't remember\n\n\nwhere we were

won't participate in this movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll put a hood over your head,\n\n\nlike I did over mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI filmed myself with a hood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Want one?\n\n\n- No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI enlisted in 1999,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nafter volunteering with\n\n\na leftist youth movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI did 20 months of \"Yael\"\n\n\nreconnaissance unit training\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I was a combat soldier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a small \"elite\" unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels like you could be\n\n\nthrown out anytime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's how elite units work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou do your best\n\n\nnot to be thrown out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training period is\n\n\ndivided into a few parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, regular basic training\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand then unit basic training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen weeks in the woods,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwenty guys in two tents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe live in those tents\n\n\nand everything happens there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's 99% humiliation and harassment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand 1% field skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown on the ground!\n\n\nForward charge! etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what you do more than anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis make long treks\n\n\nand carry weights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt my peak, toward the end,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could carry 100%\n\n\nof my body weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI carried the equivalent\n\n\nof my self for a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had to carry as much\n\n\nas possible, and we'd compete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI remember trying\n\n\nto reach 82 kilos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd eat to gain weight,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto raise my percentages,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto carry with the big

the truth\n\n\nyou'll be offended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe you think it's\n\n\ngood for the film, but...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first told me,\n\n\nI was mad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Will you stop it a second?\n\n\n- Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou didn't stop it, liar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy stop it?\n\n\nJust tell me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's weird to talk about it now,\n\n\nit's not related to anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes it does,\n\n\nit's something I'm dealing with...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes up in our lives\n\n\nfrom time to time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I can't just talk\n\n\nabout it all of a sudden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the morning,\n\n\nwith a sore throat, in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI asked you to stop filming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not retarded,\n\n\nI see the red light is on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its heyday in Lebanon,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere it would lay\n\n\nexplosive devices,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe unit hasn't done a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe soldiers mainly work out\n\n\nat the gym or go running.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's 99% of what we'd do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd see lots of plays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- \"Culture Sundays\"?\n\n\n- Yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd go to the weekly ball game,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe'd get free tickets...\n\n\nBut otherwise do nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally,\n\n\n\n\n\n\na big plan would get drawn up,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand we'd start\n\n\ntraining for it big time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlow up a house here,\n\n\ndo something else there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it never happened.\n\n\nIt always got canceled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil the 2nd Intifada began.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, I was already a combat soldier,\n\n\nthe unit began looking for \"jobs\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe realized \"action\" wouldn't come\n\n\nunless we went looking for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to Beit Jala.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commanders there\n\n\nrealized they had...\n\n\n\n\n\n\na great combat unit\n\n\nwith nothing to do,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand they can send us\n\n\non the worst missions,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbecause we're so hungry for action\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand eager to kill,\n\n\nthat we'd do anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Beit Jala we returned to base,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe had this terrible feeling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat everyone else\n\n\ngets to do things,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile we, an elite unit,\n\n\ndon't get to do anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an IDF thing.\n\n\nEvery soldier feels like\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthey're in the best unit,\n\n\nwith the best fighters,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntheir operations\n\n\nare the most amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone is Chuck Norris.\n\n\nEveryone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe did too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's frustrating,\n\n\nwith all this build-up,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto find yourself at home,\n\n\nI mean on base,\n\n\n\n\n\n\njust jerking off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShall we do it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we rolling?\n\n\nOkay, cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMask his face\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso we can talk to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave

train for the job,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntogether with another unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey trained and trained,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuntil they finally did it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore hand, a guy from my unit\n\n\nsaid there was a problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbecause you can't see\n\n\nwhat's going on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo activate the charge\n\n\nyou need to push a button,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut you can't really see,\n\n\nthere's no eye contact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can't know exactly\n\n\nwhen to activate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen...\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrary to my unit's\n\n\nrecommendation,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthey decided to put\n\n\na touch-sensitive device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you as much as touch this thing,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit explodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey set up the device,\n\n\nand the next day\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfive kids on their way to school...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry, four kids\n\n\non their way to school\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstepped on it and\n\n\nwere blown to bits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour brothers...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwere killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm seeking forgiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm looking for someone to\n\n\nabsolve me of this whole thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you won't...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted you to forgive me so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I told you about it\n\n\nand we fought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you haven't forgiven me.\n\n\nYou won't absolve me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm asking you\n\n\nto forgive me, somehow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you won't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now I'm able to forgive you\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand I understand your\n\n\nneed to be absolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt really is, as you say,\n\n\n\"forgiveness.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou didn't use this term before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForgiveness is when\n\n\nyou've done something\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand you regret it\n\n\nand ask to be forgiven for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want someone\n\n\nto acknowledge your regret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't always like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first you just wanted me\n\n\nto understand you,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto hug you and tell you\n\n\nI understand why you did it,\n\n\n\n\n\n\neven if it was wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now that you're older\n\n\nand wiser, it's okay,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbecause you were\n\n\njust young and foolish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't accept it then\n\n\nand I don't accept it now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy forgiveness presumes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat now as an adult\n\n\nyou can reflect on it...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand understand it...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand you're angry\n\n\nabout it and hate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee what I mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy forgiveness is to try\n\n\nto understand psychologically\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhow a person can do\n\n\nsuch a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe it sounds patronizing,\n\n\nbut I know, at least I hope,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat in a similar situation\n\n\nI'd act differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne night we went out on\n\n\na search and seizure operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were based at Ofer camp,\n\n\non Road 443,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback when there were still\n\n\nshootings on 443.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were on the bus\n\n\nand suddenly it stopped,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't remember\n\n\nwhere we were headed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething happened,\n\n\nwe didn't know what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bus stopped for two hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur commanders got on their phones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we headed to the base\n\n\nof Battalion 605.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Corps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe entered a briefing room\n\n\nand our commander went upstairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we waited,\n\n\nwe heard there'd been an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix Engineering Corps soldiers\n\n\nwere killed at a checkpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShot at close range\n\n\n\n\n\n\non a foggy night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur commander returns and says\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat we're going on\n\n\na revenge mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn eye for an eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey killed six of ours,\n\n\nwe'll kill six of theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey showed us on the map\n\n\na Palestinian checkpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea was\n\n\nto go there at night\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand when they came\n\n\nin the morning,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkill the Palestinian policemen\n\n\nwho manned it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree other units were to do\n\n\nthe same at three other sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParatroopers, reconnaissance\n\n\nand another engineering unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Can we trade places?\n\n\n- No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, bon appetite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me my story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- What, and ruin my meal?\n\n\n- Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean by \"tell\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell it as if...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're telling a friend\n\n\nabout something I've done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Is there more bread?\n\n\n- Here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Let's toast another one.\n\n\n- In a minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you were in the army\n\n\nyou were taken one night,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the middle of the night,\n\n\nsnatched from your sleep,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou didn't know where,\n\n\nthey just said: \"We're going...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not polite to speak\n\n\nand eat at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey put you on a bus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand said:\n\n\n\"We're going on a revenge mission,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"to kill four Palestinians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't think you asked\n\n\ntoo many questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou were all highly motivated and...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthrilled and delighted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto finally realize\n\n\nyour wet dream of...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkilling some Arabs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you arrived somewhere,\n\n\nyou had no idea where.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think it was...\n\n\nI don't remember the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it seemed...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike a God-forsaken place,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnot much there except for\n\n\na Palestinian police outpost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll you knew is that\n\n\nterrorists came from there...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, the day before...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome terrorists came\n\n\nfrom that area\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand killed...\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwo soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor five...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor six...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand killed six soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo an order was given\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby whoever it was at the time...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho was it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chief of Staff gave the order\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand you were sent to kill\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfour people...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin their stead?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's just so absurd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have the exact words\n\n\nto describe it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt happened somewhere out-there,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndon't bring it over-here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust don't bring out-there,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nover-here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a story about a soldier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwho was raised to be\n\n\none of the hot-shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho was cultivated to wait\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuntil they let him,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuntil they let him charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil they let him feel the itch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis service will soon be over,\n\n\nso they ordered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Go on, gallop!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Down the valley,\n\n\nup the mountain.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil

tell me\n\n\nwhat the Field Marshal means?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision Commander Han,\n\n\nyou're a frank man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat my father meant was,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif you could attack from the east,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand us from the west;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince General Luo doesn't have\n\n\nthat big an army,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you'll be General Han.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung master, but...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your worries?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've enough troops to do the job,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexcept...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot enough weapons?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne

true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've arrived?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's so...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed is precious in war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, indeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the thousand machine guns,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou've got

You glue them up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Palych draws them.\n\n\n- Well done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think everything is going well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- And who'll represent the clay room?\n\n\n- Ivan.

Thatch your roof\n\n\nbefore rainy weather\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Yeah, right.\n\n\n- Where is he?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Check this out!\n\n\n- What is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- This is...\n\n\n- 'Dead Souls'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt'll take him\n\n\na while to finish it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt school I once wrote\n\n\nan essay on 'Dead Souls'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got an F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd my dad lathered me. After that\n\n\nI know Gogol backwards and forwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelinsky said that Gogol Is\n\n\nPushkin in prose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when Gogol started writing\n\n\nthat Christian Orthodox stuff,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhe published a book called\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Selected Passages\n\n\nFrom Correspondence with Friends'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe quite unexpectedly reasoned that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'a nation is just like kids\n\n\nin a family' and that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'the church should\n\n\nshepherd this flock'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter which Belinsky severely\n\n\ncriticized Gogol in a letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wrote that 'Russia's salvation\n\n\nis not about mysticism or asceticism,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut the success of civilization,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenlightenment and humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia does not\n\n\nneed sermons or prayers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt needs self-respect\n\n\nof common people.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeez! I still remember\n\n\nthis quote after so many years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI totally agree with Belinsky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feeling of self-respect is\n\n\njust what our people need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, that was\n\n\na decisive moment in history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEither the nation would stand up\n\n\nand move forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor it would be illiterate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand bear the hardships forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know nothing about Belinsky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went to Soviet schools.\n\n\nWe were taught superbly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn A+ education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood I caught up with you.\n\n\nIs this your parcel?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Yes, it's mine. Thank you.\n\n\n- See you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey try to make you believe\n\n\na convenient theory about our past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress comes when we honor\n\n\ntraditions and criticize the present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know how they teach history\n\n\nat school these days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are distorting the truth\n\n\nabout the gains of our revolution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I know.\n\n\nAnd what were the gains?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell it's obvious.\n\n\nEducation, upward social mobility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's when your parents are\n\n\nblue collar workers,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand you seem to be destined\n\n\nto become one yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you're really bright,\n\n\nyou may work in the government\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd think of industrialization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Lots of people were killed in vain!\n\n\n- Yeah, a lot of people vanished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the result was positive\n\n\nin the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't like the reign\n\n\nof Ivan the Terrible,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwho slaughtered thousands,\n\n\ndevastated Russia and also\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlost a war to the Germans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- What Germans?\n\n\n- The Livonian Order. It was German.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the bloodiest war back then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the reign of Ivan the Terrible\n\n\nthe Tartars burnt Moscow down\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor the first time\n\n\nin 100 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he killed his own heir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interesting comparison, eh?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know what really excites me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody really raises\n\n\nor educates our youth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Self-education is the only option.\n\n\n- That's right!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you're naturally gifted,\n\n\nyou'll find a way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you don't care,\n\n\nyou'll remain as you are...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Good evening.\n\n\n- Hi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to come earlier tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Maybe you'll need some help?\n\n\n- Yeah, sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome earlier.\n\n\nWhat were you guys watching?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAskoldov's 'Commissar'.\n\n\nWhat a great film!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood job!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Well, see you tomorrow.\n\n\n- See you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- So...\n\n\n- They watch good films.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's right. I've been\n\n\nto their lectures several times now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cinema club guys\n\n\nteach me so many things now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey gave me some DVDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the French new wave of the 60s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese guys caused a revolution\n\n\nin cinematography back then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Revolution?\n\n\n- What revolution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolution is a metaphor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose guys were cinematographers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd they revolutionized\n\n\nthe cinematography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait a sec...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold this for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI took some notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have the exact wording.\n\n\nI'll tell you in my own words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were the first to use\n\n\nBerthold Brecht's system in movies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey introduced a new kind of a hero\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwho could perform\n\n\nunmotivated actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir characters would speak\n\n\nwhile being filmed from behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait a sec... Oh, that's Egorov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes? And then\n\n\nthey lectured me on Godard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey had a whole lecture on him.\n\n\nAnd here is what...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't understand much,\n\n\nbut I took some notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cinematography there are\n\n\ntwo principal systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brecht system\n\n\nand the Hollywood system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also refer to the latter one\n\n\nas the Stanislavski system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Brecht's system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the alienation\n\n\nof the film from the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when I am looking into the camera,\n\n\nthat is alienation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if I...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there's a blood bath\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich makes you feel really involved,\n\n\nthat's Hollywood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't get a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's impressive.\n\n\nI didn't understand much,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut these guys are smart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- You should go to the cinema club.\n\n\n- Wait!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Brecht,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhen you see some action,\n\n\nyou switch on your brain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand you are aware\n\n\nthat you're audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all of your problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Hollywood subl...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSublimates negative energies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait, I'll give you a quote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollywood sublimates\n\n\nnegative energies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand subdues protest impulses,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso the viewer drowns in the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't get any of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, come on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo me it was really interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't get a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I'll write it down for you\n\n\nin a more graspable...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I want to say again...\n\n\nYou know what?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's go there together.\n\n\nYou'll really like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's so great to find out\n\n\nabout all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- It's all about revolution.\n\n\n- Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait for me, ok?\n\n\nI'll go looking for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust imagine\n\n\nwhat he got interested in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- He is a good guy.\n\n\n- Yeah,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergetic and active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're old.
